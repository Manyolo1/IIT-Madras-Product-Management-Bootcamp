# Week 1 Assignment: Introduction to Product Management

## Part 1
Create a 1-2 slide presentation on a new GenAI product listing the: 
1. USPs (Unique selling points)
2. Target Audience and Pain point being served
3. Value Proposition 

### My Approach:
As this was just week 1 of the bootcamp, all I could work on was something simplistic, and it was still fun!
I started by thinking about some problems I face myself, that either I'm not good at or, I would love outsourcing to AI.
I chose latter. I practice reflecting daily, with the aim of revisiting my notes on my progress for the week/ month and explore repetitions and patterns, however that rarely ever happens.
So, I decided to think of solving my own problem, using GenAI. 

Reflect-IQ, is an app that offers a minimalistic UI for journalling, and keeps the data and analyses trends and patterns in the user's behaviour, kind of like a coach studying the player and working on a gameplan/ playbook.
The pattern analysis can be carried out via Data Science and ML, and the insights/ gameplan can be delivered by the LLM, and you could personalise, and have the model to act as the personality that supports your growth, maybe a strict military head, a football coach, or even your mom!
By identifying patterns in users’ progress and data, it offers data-backed insights that guide users toward smarter decision-making. 
This could be specific to a niche, like tracking and creating action steps for your fitness journey, or simply your coding practice. Make it your own!

Here's a not so detailed version of this in this PPT: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h-5WqkvB7QUxDIqbIWiQ1KJRNBVtRNrr15HEyBcOii0/edit?usp=sharing

## Part 2
Compare two similar AI products that compete closely .Create a  video, and highlight The unique differentiators of each product. How one product might appeal more to specific user segments. Also suggest an improvement suggestion for each product to strengthen its market position. (

### My Approach:
Again, being a newbie, I relied on my intuitive product sense to compare the top models - ChatGPT and Claude. Now, I devised an approach to analyse the features by splitting them and visualising them into two categories :
1. Tech features 
2. UI features 

In this Assignment, I focussed only on the UI features.

This may have been a simple and fundamental exercise, but I had a blast diving into the world of products and thinking like a product enthusiast!
